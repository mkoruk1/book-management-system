# Book-Management-System

Creted a Book Management System in c++ language using Linked Lists, Fstream library and classes. 

You can add books, delete books and see the avaible book list. I also added Database to the program to store datas to the file and load the datas inside the file to the program.
I used Code::Blocks to develop the project. If you don't have Code::Blocks I added single main.cpp file inside the SingleFile folder.

If your data is not loaded from the database, delete the Database.txt file, it will automatically create a new file and your problem will be solved.
