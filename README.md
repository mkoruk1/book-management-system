# Book-Management-System

Created a Book Management System in c++ language using Linked List and classes. 

You can add books, delete books and see the available book list. I also created a database for the program to store data in the file and load the data inside the file to the program. I used Code::Blocks to develop the project. If you don't have Code::Blocks I added a single main.cpp file inside the SingleFile folder.

If your data is not loaded from the database, delete the Database.txt file, it will automatically create a new file and your problem will be solved.
